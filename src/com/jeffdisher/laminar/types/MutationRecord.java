/**
 * Laminar is built on 2 kinds of data:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Mutations:  These are generated on the leader from valid ClientMessages.  They are written to the "input" stream
 *  when committing to disk.  They are sent to followers in the cluster.  They are sent to reconnecting clients.  In a
 *  sense, they are the "independent variables".</li>
 * <li>Events:  These are generated by every node in the cluster when processing a mutation (when a node decides or is told
 *  that it should commit).  They are written to the "per-topic" stream when committing to disk.  They are only ever
 *  sent to listeners.  In a sense, they are the "dependent variables".  Note that, even though every node creates
 *  these, the mapping from the mutation to event is deterministic so every node derives the same answer.</li>
 * </ul>
 * It is worth noting that that processing a single mutation normally produces a single event but programmable topics
 * can work differently where a mutation can result in 0 or several events being generated.
 * 
 * This class represents the logical representation of the mutation, as well as its physical
 * serialization/deserialization logic.
